      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I am Ashish R Menon currently working as a senior Engineer in the ML Camera team for Qualcomm India R&D. Here I work on ML models targetting perceptual human vision 
        tasks in computational photography optimized for mobile camera systems. I design models to work on real time Image signal processor pipelines owning the end to end model design, 
        quantization and Image Quality assesment. I completed by masters by research from IIIT Hyderabad under the guidance of Prof. Dr. C V Jawahar and Prof. Dr. P.K. Vinod. 
        Here I worked on deep learning assisted cancer diagnosis using digitized tissue images under limited supervision setting. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and AI, with a strong
        focus on models that can generalize well in a data efficient and energy efficient manner. I also get excited to understand and extrapolate the knowledge embedded within models, analysing them beyond the conventional way of treating them as black box
        function approximators and has been a consistent theme throughout my research rigour. As a side hustle I am currently exploring ideas like
        retrieval augmented generations usng foundational model representations, Diffusion models guided super image resolution, efficient inference.
        I also get excited about perceving the 3D aspects of vision and draw parallels between 2DV and 3DV.
